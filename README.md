# Time Calculator

This is the second project out of five that I completed as part of the 'Scientific Computing with Python' course from freeCodeCamp. For this project, I worked on Replit using their test code to develop a function. The function takes a start time, a duration, and an optional starting day of the week. It adds the duration to the start time, accounting for days passed, and displays the result with optional day information.
